## 1. Background & Motivation

So my brother is notorious for making terrible jokes at all times of the day. Granted, some of these jokes will land and they can be quite funny, but most of them tend to fall flat.
So I thought it would be fun to track all of his terrible jokes for all the world to see!
But as a computer science student, it's my duty to makes things more MoDuLaR I guess, so instead of a an application solely for the
purpose of rating my brother's jokes, this app will allow you to rate any person's jokes!

## 2. The Stack

I'll be building this application with the following

### LANGUAGE
- Typescript
Decided that it's probably time I probably learn TS and what better way to do it then through this project.

### FRONTEND
- Next.js 
- React
- Material UI

### BACKEND
- Airtable (database)
- Express
- Netlify (severless functions)
- Firebase (to host and authenticate the app)


## 3. To Do (Frontend)

The frontend is split into  feature sets which will make up the MVP for this application.

### 3.1. Feature Set 1. Authentication
